# arduzaku
1/35 zaku head integration with arduino

zaku-digispark.ino to being used with digispark boards, include SimpleServo.h library, since normal servo doesn't work with digispark boards.

you can print the zaku-digispark-board.pdf and etch your own boards.

Folow the desing in zaku-digispark.board.pdf to connect the components.

10kh resistor for the push button is needed.

220h resistor for the led is needed.

I used the round headers for the board and digispark since they are smaller, but you can use any headers you want.

If you have a diferent arduino board, just change the pin numbers and use the default the #zaku-arduino.ino# file.


Good luck!
